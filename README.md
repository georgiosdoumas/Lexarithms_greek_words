# Lexarithms_greek_words
  A bash script to read Greek words (either many words from a txt file , either one word that the user will interactively input) and find the arithmetic value of the word.
  Later I want to find somehow a txt file with as many Greek words as possible , and use this program to read all the words from the file , and populate a mysql database.
